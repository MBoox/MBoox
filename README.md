- 👋 Hi, I’m @MBoox
- 👀 I’m interested in applied mathematics (stochastic and statistical models) and python programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data structures and algorithms
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate on something, but as soon as I feel more confident with my python skills, I would like to collaborate on plant growth modelling, optimization and origami
